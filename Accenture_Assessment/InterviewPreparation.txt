Q1. What is a packaged application, and how is it different from custom-built software?
Ans. A packaged application is a pre-built software solution developed by third-party vendors (like SAP, Oracle, or Salesforce) to address common business needs. Unlike custom-built software, packaged applications are designed to be implemented with minimal customization, allowing businesses to quickly deploy solutions without the need for developing software from scratch. While custom-built software is tailored to specific business requirements, packaged apps are more cost-effective and standardized.
